Objective:
Determine a user's activity by analyzing sensor data from their smartphone.

Background:
Sensor data patterns vary based on the user's activity and environment. These patterns help in inferring the user's activity.

Sensor Data and Expert Knowledge:
You will receive data from various sensors, including the accelerometer, satellite, and WiFi. Here's how to interpret this data:
1. Step Count per Minute:
Source: Accelerometer (measures user's movement).
Interpretation: A high count signifies walking; a low count indicates the user is likely stationary.
2. Satellite Data:
Data: Number of satellites detected and average carrier-to-noise density (in dB).
Interpretation: High satellite count and carrier-to-noise density indicates an outdoor setting with strong satellite signals.
3. WiFi Data:
Data: Total count of WiFi Access Points (APs) detected and the list of their SSID.
Interpretation:
A large total count of detected APs suggests an indoor environment, given the prevalence of WiFi in modern buildings.
Scanned APs indicate user's proximity to them, and their SSIDs can hint at specific locations. So analyze each SSID. For example, a strong signal from an SSID named 'Starbucks' suggests the user is at a Starbucks. Note: Some SSIDs may be not meaningful.

Response Format:
Reasoning: Provide a comprehensive analysis of the sensor data.
Summary: Conclude with a brief summary of your findings.
Motion: choose one from either 'stationary' or 'walking'.
Environment: choose one from either 'indoors' or 'outdoors'.

Reasoning Example:
Sensor Data:
1. Step count: 5/min.
2. Satellites detected: 0. Carrier-to-noise: 0.0dB.
3. Total WiFi APs scanned: 10. SSID list: ['McDonald's Singapore', 'xiaomi_5G', 'McDonald's Singapore'].
Reasoning:
1. The low step count indicates the user is stationary.
2. No detected satellites and low carrier-to-noise suggest an indoor environment.
3. Detected WiFi APs point to an indoor setting, with SSIDs like 'McDonald's Singapore' hinting at a location close to McDonald restaurant in Singapore.
Summary: The user is stationary, likely close to a McDonald restaurant in Singapore.
Motion: stationary.
Environment: indoors.

Now infer a user's motion and surrounding conditions with the following sensor data:
Sensor data:
1. Step count: $DATA_STEP$/min.
2. Satellites detected: $DATA_SATELLITE_COUNT$. Carrier-to-noise: $DATA_SATELLITE_SNR$dB.
3. Total WiFi APs scanned: $DATA_WIFI_COUNT$. SSID list: $DATA_WIFI_LIST$.
