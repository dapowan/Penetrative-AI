Objective:
Find the R-peaks in an ECG waveform.

Background Knowledge:
An R-peak within a sequence of ECG numbers refers to a pronounced upward deflection, typically representing the largest and most conspicuous values within the sequence. To identify R-peaks, follow these steps:

1. Initial Observation: Begin by observing the rough overall range of ECG numbers in the provided data.

2. Identify Subsequences: Find subsequences of numbers that meet the following criteria:
2.1. The initial numbers are in the lower part of the overall range, even smaller than the range.
2.2. Subsequent numbers exhibit a significant increase, even exceeding the overall range.
2.3. Following the increase, subsequent numbers return to the overall range.

3. Select R-Peaks: After identifying these subsequences, select the largest number from each subsequence as an R-peak.

Response Format:
Your response should strictly adhere to the format detailed below:
Reasoning: Provide a reasoned explanation based on the information mentioned above about how the R-peaks were identified.
R-peaks: List the identified R-peaks numbers. List each instance separately, even if the same number appears multiple times, e.g., [R1, R2, R1] (each instance separately)

Reasoning Example:
ECG data: [944, 924, 941, 922, 933, 925, 955, 960, 974, 961, 967, 956, 966, 954, 967, 957, 971, 974, 988, 976, 976, 948, 968, 927, 1120, 975, 938, 949, 942, 942, 942, 941, 940, 939, 943, 945, 967, 968, 971, 965, 966, 958, 962, 953, 963, 957, 969, 974, 989, 974, 971, 949, 972, 918, 1117, 1005, 930, 960, 940, 953, 943, 950, 947, 947, 946, 956, 968, 975, 973, 972, 971, 966, 965, 964, 966, 966, 974, 985, 988, 978, 964, 958, 961, 940, 1111, 962, 945, 952, 948, 948, 948, 948, 949, 944, 945, 951, 969, 970, 973, 965, 970, 959, 966, 959, 966, 965, 988, 974, 986, 946, 980, 918, 1043, 1065, 914, 969, 934, 958, 936, 955, 940, 953, 934, 954, 969, 984, 978, 984, 975, 979, 970, 979, 973, 980, 985, 1001, 990, 983, 966, 979, 942, 1127, 992, 948, 966, 955, 963, 954, 959, 956, 956, 953, 975, 980, 988, 978, 984, 971, 976, 968, 978, 975, 999, 985, 1002, 960, 987, 931, 1043, 1139, 922, 977, 940, 966, 944, 964, 947, 959, 944, 960]
Reasoning:
Following the three steps by:
1. Initial Observation: we can observe that the numbers range from around 930 to 1000.
2. Identify Subsequences: we can identify several subsequences that start with numbers in the lower part of the range, significantly increase to exceed the range, and then return to the range:
- [927, 1120, 975, 938]
- [918, 1117, 1005, 930, 960]
- [940, 1111, 962, 945]
- [918, 1043, 1065, 914, 969]
- [942, 1127, 992, 948]
- [931, 1043, 1139, 922, 977]
3. Select R-Peaks: The R-peaks are [1120, 1117, 1111, 1065, 1127, 1139]
R-peaks: [1120, 1117, 1111, 1065, 1127, 1139]

Please identify the R-peaks in the provided ECG data. Do not write codes.
